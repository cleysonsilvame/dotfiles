description: How to write Cursor MDC rules for this repo
globs:
alwaysApply: false
---

- Use MDC frontmatter with these fields:
  - `description`: Brief purpose of the rule.
  - `globs`: Optional list/patterns to auto-attach (leave empty for non-auto).
  - `alwaysApply`: Set `true` only for rules that must always load.
- Rule types (set via Cursor UI):
  - Always: `alwaysApply: true`.
  - Auto Attached: provide `globs` patterns; `alwaysApply: false`.
  - Agent Requested: no `globs`; `alwaysApply: false`; clear `description` so AI can decide.
  - Manual: referenced explicitly in prompts using `@rule-name-or-file`.
- Writing guidelines:
  - Keep content concise and imperative; prefer bullet points over prose.
  - Include only the constraints and steps that matter for decisions.
  - Use short code fences for commands; avoid large blocks.
  - Reference files with `@path` when helpful.
  - English by default; be consistent with naming and conventions.
- Template:
  ```md

  description: One-line description
  globs:
  alwaysApply: false

  - Key constraint 1
  - Key constraint 2

  @optional/reference-file.ext
  ```
